# Public Procurement Contracts 

This README provides a guide for scraping data from the website [base.gov](www.base.gov.pt), the website that provides information on public procurement contracts in Portugal. This scraping was made for All4Integrity, an NGO dedicated to fighting corruption through data exposure. All4Integrity believes that transparency is key to preventing and combating corruption, and works to promote accountability and integrity in public and private institutions.

All4Integrity uses the information to identify potential cases of corruption, analyze trends and patterns in public procurement contracts, and provide evidence-based recommendations for improving transparency and accountability in public spending. The data can also be used to support investigative journalism and empower citizens to demand greater transparency and accountability from their elected representatives.
